Installation Instructions:

Upon launching the site, click to sign-up and follow instructions for entering an email address and password to create a user. Seed data will be assigned to you as the first user.

Technologies Used:
- Devise for authenticating users
- Ruby on Rails

Unsolved Problems:
- an items index page showing the same item and it price-per-unit of measure across all stores belonging to the user.
- perhaps a tool for converting the price of one measure of an item to the price of a different measure for apples to apples comparison. For example, a 59 ounce carton of orange juice for $2.99 would be shown to be the equivalent of a $3.24 priced 64 ounce carton of orange juice. This might make it easier for users uncomfortable reading decimal floats greater than two places to make the comparison easily without feeling nerves over their basic math skills.
- the programming code should be refactored more, with a greater reliance on form helpers. (Some refactoring has been done on working_branch but wasn't able to be reformatted in time.)
- better use should be made of CSS to improve the layout of the site.
