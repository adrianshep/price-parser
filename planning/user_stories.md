User Stories:

1. As a shopper, I want to independently calculate the price per unit of the item I'm considering (e.g., 64 oz. orange juice for $3.29 is $0.0514 per oz.), because store staffers sometimes create erroneous price per unit stickers.

2. As a shopper, I want to be able to convert prices per unit between units of measurement, because sometimes items are measured by different systems, e.g., ounces vs. grams.

3. As a shopper, I want to be able to save item prices per unit so I can recall and compare them whenever I come across the same item at another time or place that seems like a good deal.

4. As a shopper, I want to be able to tie my saved item priced per unit to the store carrying it, so I can compare all the same or similar items carried by other stores I patronize.

5. As a shopper, I want to be able to distinguish between types of saved items priced per unit, e.g., regular mayonnaise vs. low fat mayonnaise.

6. As a shopper, if an item priced per unit I've saved is on special for a limited time, I want to be able to attach an expiration date to that price per unit and, ideally, automatically remove it when it expires or revert it to its regular price per unit after the date.

7. As a shopper, I want to be able to add a note to the items I've priced per unit so I may record important features that may make a qualitative difference to me between items priced per unit, e.g., orange juice at $0.0514 per oz. with 200 grams sugar per serving vs orange juice at $0.0600 per oz. but with only 100 grams sugar per serving.
